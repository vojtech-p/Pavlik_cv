Instructions:

1. The goal of the project:
The goal of the project is to develop an algorithm for the detection and classification of sleep apnea.

2. Introduction to the topic, methods:
An introduction to the topic and an overview of sleep apnea detection methods can be found e.g. in [1] and [2]. Both sources
are available on e-learning. Many more can be found on the Internet.

3. Guidelines for developing algorithms:
Your task is to create an apneaDetection function. The input of this function will be a minute segment
more signals included in the dataset file: air flow (data.Flow), air pressure
(data.Pres), chest movements (data.Thor), abdominal movements (data.Abdo) and oxygen saturation
(data.SpO2). The output of the function will be the numerical value of the diagnosis estimate: 1 (central apnea), 2
(obstructive apnea), 3 (hypopnea) and 4 (no pathological respiratory event). The function will be called
from the main script, which uses additional files needed for data loading and evaluation
results (Annotation, dataset, F1score). Only modify the apneaDetection function, any modification
main and other supplied files is undesirable.

4. Data:
To develop and test your algorithm, you will use selected data (dataset) from the MESA database [3].
The sampling rates of the Flow, Pres, Thor and Abdo signals are 32 Hz, 1 Hz was used for the SpO2 signal.
The data file is supplemented by an annotation.txt file with the numerical designation of individual diagnoses
signals.
